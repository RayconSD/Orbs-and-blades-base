The Concept 

Orbs and Blade is reken slash, top-down genre. The main idea is to move your character like in a MOBA, but perform special attacks like in a classic fighting game (such as Street Fighter). 

When you press an attack button, you need to move your mouse around your character to execute a special attack. For example, if you press "E" and move your mouse backwards and then drag it forward, your character will perform a lunge.
